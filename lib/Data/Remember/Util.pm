# ABSTRACT: common helper utilities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Remember::Util qw( process_que init_brain );

  my $clean_que = process_que($handy_que);
  my $brain = init_brain($name, @args);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are some common helper utilities used by L<Data::Remember::Class> and some of the brain implementations. Unless you are building a custom brain, you probably don't need these.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 process_que

  my $clean_que = process_que($handy_que);

The format defined in L<Data::Remember::Class/QUE> is very flexible. That section describes how all the flexible que formats are mapped into a canonical form. This is utility subroutine that does that clean-up process.

This is performed automatically on behalf of each brain by L<Data::Remember::Class>, so you do not normally need this if you are just implementing the usual brain functions. However, if you have custom methods that require additional features, you may want this helper.

sub process_que {
    my $que = shift;

    my @ques;
    if (ref $que eq 'ARRAY') {
        @ques = @$que;
    }

    elsif (ref $que eq 'HASH') {
        for my $key (sort keys %$que) {
            push @ques, $key, $que->{$key};
        }
    }

    else {
        @ques = ($que);
    }

    for my $que (@ques) {
        return undef unless defined $que;
    }

    return \@ques;
}

=head2 init_brain

  my $brain = init_brain($module, @args);

This is a helper that checks the arguments given, loads the brain class for
the given module name, constructs a brain, and returns it.

    my $brain = shift;

    $brain = 'Data::Remember::' . $brain
